/**
 * Runs an action as soon as the Minecraft client has exited, then ends the JVM.
 *
 * <p>Why this is needed: when the player quits, the render thread returns from
 * {@code Minecraft#run()} and {@code net.minecraft.client.main.Main} starts its post-main watchdog
 * just before {@code main()} returns. The JVM only shuts down once every non-daemon thread has
 * finished, and {@code com.sun.net.httpserver} owns a non-daemon {@code HTTP-Dispatcher} thread
 * per server (this mod's, plus one for every other mod that uses it). Any such thread left behind
 * makes {@code DestroyJavaVM} wait; 15 seconds later the watchdog writes a bogus
 * {@code Client shutdown from post-main} crash report and calls {@code System.exit(-8)}.</p>
 *
 * <p>A JVM shutdown hook cannot help there: the JVM never begins to shut down, so the hook never
 * runs. This watcher instead listens for the client thread to die, tears this mod's own stuff
 * down, and then exits the JVM explicitly. Other mods can leave non-daemon threads behind as well
 * (Baritone keeps a worker pool), so simply stopping our HTTP server is not always enough.</p>
 *
 * <p>By the time the watcher fires, Minecraft has already run {@code exitWorldAndClose()} - the
 * world is saved, the window is closed - and {@code System.exit} still runs every shutdown hook
 * (Minecraft's own included), so this only skips the watchdog.</p>
